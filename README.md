# RovicareOCR

Project I did as part of an internship at Rovicare, a Medical communications technology startup. This code can take in certain medical forms and use OpenCV to read and output medical data from the forms to a json output.  
The project is designed to run as an API. Use the DIRECTIONS file provided to use the API and see it in action. The API uses data for accessing Google Cloud Storage, which you will have to initialize.
